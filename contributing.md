## Report a bug

[File an issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) if you find a bug in the AMP Plugin. Providing details for each section predefined in the issue template is much appreciated!

Project maintainers are regularly monitoring issues and aim to fix open bugs quickly.

## Make a suggestion

[File a "feature request" issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) if you have a suggestion for a way to improve the AMP Plugin, or a request for a new feature.

## Product and code contributions

We'd love to have your help contributing code and features to the AMP Plugin! Head to the [Project Management guidelines](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/blob/develop/contributing/project-management.md) as well as [Engineering guidelines](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/blob/develop/contributing/engineering.md) for details on the process you can use to contribute.

## Contributor license agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Contributors list policy

The list of contributors who are featured on the WordPress.org plugin directory are subject to change over time. The organizations and individuals who contribute significantly and consistently (e.g. 3-month period) to the project are eligible to be listed. Those listed should generally be considered as those who take responsibility for the project (i.e. owners). Note that contributions include more than just code, though contributors who commit are [most visible](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/graphs/contributors). The sort order of the contributors list should generally follow the sort order of the GitHub contributors page, though again, this order does not consider work in issues and the support forum, so it cannot be relied on solely.
